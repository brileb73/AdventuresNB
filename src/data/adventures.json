This river conains a set of beautiful waterfalls. After another 2 hours or so, you'll reach the 'Eye of the Needle'. This is where the walls of the gorge become very narrow and you need to enter the water to continue on the trail. Another half hour later you'll reach an opening where the river meets the little Salmon River. This is a great spot to go for a swim.
